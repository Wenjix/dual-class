  "metaphor_logic": "In cooking, attention is like how a chef prioritizes ingredients based on what pairs best with the main dish. Just as a chef knows wine reduction enhances steak more than ketchup, the attention mechanism learns which input tokens are most relevant to each output.",
  "explanation_text": "Imagine you're a chef preparing a signature steak dish. The attention mechanism works like your instinct to pair ingredients. You have dozens of options—wines, sauces, herbs, sides. But your attention immediately focuses on what complements steak: wine reduction, garlic butter, rosemary. You assign 'attention weights'—wine reduction gets 80%, garlic butter 15%, rosemary 5%. Ketchup gets 0%. This is exactly how transformer attention works: for each word it generates, it scans all input words and assigns weights based on relevance, focusing computational resources where they matter most.",

Garlic butter adds richness. Rosemary provides aromatics. Ketchup? It would overpower everything. Each ingredient has a relationship strength with the steak.",
      "literal_text": "In transformers, each token (word) has a relationship with every other token. The model computes similarity scores between tokens using query and key vectors. These scores determine which tokens should influence each other during processing. High scores mean strong relationships, low scores mean weak connections.",

      "literal_text": "Attention weights are computed by softmax-normalizing the similarity scores. This creates a probability distribution that sums to 1.0.

Just as a chef focuses effort on perfecting the dominant pairing, the attention mechanism focuses computational resources where they create the greatest impact on the output.",
