  "metaphor_logic": "Space navigation requires prioritizing sensor data based on threat level and mission relevance. Just as a captain focuses scanners on approaching vessels rather than distant asteroids, the attention mechanism dynamically allocates processing power to the most important input tokens.",
  "explanation_text": "You're commanding a starship approaching a space station. Your sensors detect hundreds of objects: the station itself, cargo ships, defense satellites, asteroids, a distant nebula. Your attention mechanism works like tactical prioritization—the station gets 70% scanner focus (your destination), nearby cargo ships 20% (collision risk), defense satellites 10% (authorization needed). The distant nebula? 0% attention—beautiful, but irrelevant to docking. Transformers do exactly this: for each word being processed, they scan all input words and assign attention weights, concentrating computational power where it matters most for the current task.",

Defense satellites require clearance—relevant but secondary. The nebula is light-years away—no operational relationship. Each object has a tactical relevance score.",
      "literal_text": "In transformers, each token computes its relationship with every other token through dot product attention. The model calculates similarity scores between query vectors (what you're currently processing) and key vectors (all available context).

The captain allocates it: 70% to station (navigation data, docking coordinates), 20% to cargo ships (trajectory prediction), 10% to satellites (IFF signals). Total: 100%. This distribution optimizes for successful docking while maintaining situational awareness.",
      "literal_text": "Attention weights are calculated using softmax, which converts raw similarity scores into a probability distribution summing to 1.0. High-scoring tokens receive more attention weight, meaning they contribute more to the output representation. This creates a differentiable, learnable priority system.",

      "literal_text": "Multi-head attention runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel, each with independently learned parameters. Different heads specialize in different patterns: one might capture subject-verb relationships, another word order, another semantic similarity. Their outputs are concatenated and projected, giving the model a rich, multi-faceted understanding of context.",
