# Dual Class Learning Engine ⚔️

> **Turn Your Hobbies Into a Cheat Code.**

**Here is the pitch:**
Imagine trying to learn how the **Transformer Architecture** works. It’s complicated, right? Now imagine learning it through the game mechanics of **League of Legends** or through **NFL game plan** templates. Suddenly, it clicks, because we're explaining it in a metaphorical language you already understand.

Dual Class uses **Gemini 3** to find these connections automatically and then shows you how they work through visual metaphors generated by **Nano Banana Pro**. We turn your hobbies into a master key—a **"Cheat Code"**—unlocking new skills by mapping them to the fun stuff you already know by heart. We transform your expertise in hobbies into a bridge for your career and education.

## 🚀 The Vision

Everyone has hobbies they excel at. They have thousands of hours of practice in those hobbies. Let's make use of that existing knowledge through transfer learning and visual metaphors, using **Gemini 3** and **Nano Banana Pro**.

**Our Core Promise:**
- **Translation, Not Just Explanation:** We don't just dumb things down. We map the *structural logic* of a concept (e.g., Transformer Attention) to a domain you master (e.g., a Quarterback scanning receivers).
- **Visual Metaphor Learning:** Text isn't enough. We generate custom visual metaphors that mirror your mental model.
- **Active Recall:** We verify understanding through gamified quizzes that can be answered by inspecting the generated image.
- **Context Switch:** If you don't understand the first explanation, we can try a different visual language, a different metaphor, and/or a different persona.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Tech Stack

This project is a showcase of the latest in the Gemini 3 family of generative AI.

### **The Intelligence Layer**
- **Gemini 3:** The brain of our operation. We use Gemini 3's advanced reasoning capabilities to build the "Metaphor Bridge" - the logic layer that connects source domains (gaming, sports) to target domains (CS, physics).
- **Nano Banana Pro:** Our visual engine. We leverage Nano Banana Pro's ultra-fast image generation models to create precise, metaphor-aligned diagrams in real-time.

### **The Application Layer**
- **Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) 
- **State:** React Hooks
- **Language:** TypeScript

## 🔮 Roadmap: The Future of Dual Class

We are building a comprehensive learning ecosystem. Here is what comes next:

### **1. Seasons Mode 🎓**
Learning isn't a sprint; it's a campaign.
- **Semester-Long Campaigns:** Progress through a curated 12-week curriculum (a "Season") that mirrors a university semester.
- **Weekly Quests:** New concepts unlock weekly, themed around current events in your hobby (e.g., Super Bowl week unlocks "Championship Strategy" physics lessons).

### **2. Social Learning & Shareable Loot 🤝**
- **Shareable Lessons:** Generate a perfect metaphor? Mint it as a shareable card. "I just learned Recursion via Minecraft Redstone."
- **Community Upvoting:** The community votes on the best metaphors. The most effective explanations rise to the top of the "Global Library."

### **3. Dual-Class Leaderboards 🏆**
- **Ranked Mode:** Compete against others with your specific build.
- **Diamond League Gamer-Engineers:** See who has mastered the most CS concepts through gaming.
- **Grandmaster Chef-Chemists:** A leaderboard for those mastering chemistry through cooking.

### **4. Deep Visual Knowledge Base (Qdrant) 🧠**
- **Vector Metaphor Search:** We are integrating **Qdrant** to vector-embed every successful visual metaphor.
- **Semantic Retrieval:** This empowers a "Visual RAG" system, allowing users to search for "visuals that explain recursion" and retrieving not just text, but the most successful *diagrams* generated by our community.
